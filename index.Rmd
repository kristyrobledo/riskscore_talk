???
A protein that acts as a kind of “brake” to keep the body’s immune responses under control. PD-L1 may be found on some normal cells and in higher-than-normal amounts on some types of cancer cells. When PD-L1 binds to another protein called PD-1 (a protein found on T cells), it keeps T cells from killing the PD-L1-containing cells, including the cancer cells (left panel). 

Anticancer drugs called immune checkpoint inhibitors bind to PD-L1 and block its binding to PD-1. This releases the “brakes” on the immune system and leaves T cells free to kill cancer cells (right panel).

FDA approvals of PD-1/PD-L1. 
- As of December 2020, six anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs have been approved with supplemental indications across 19 cancer types and two tissue-agnostic conditions. 
- Shown are the approvals for each cancer indication, for Keytruda (pembrolizumab), Opdivo (nivolumab), Libtayo (cemiplimab), Tecentriq (atezolizumab), Bavencio (avelumab), and Imfinzi (durvalumab). 
- Multiple approvals for a cancer indication within the same year are shown with only one symbol. The open symbols represent approvals without a biomarker (no BM). 
- The full symbols represent approvals that incorporate a biomarker with an associated threshold for each indication (BM), which was measured using either a central laboratory test or complementary diagnostic that was not approved as a CDx for the drug. 
- Symbols with a red outline represent approvals in which a companion diagnostic is indicated for biomarker measurement (BM + CDx). *: approval for MSI-H/dMMR colorectal cancer. PM, pleural mesothelioma; TNBC, triple-negative breast cancer; CSCC, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma; TMB-H, tumor mutation burden high; CRC, colorectal cancer; BCG-BC, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin bladder cancer; EC, endometrial carcinoma; ESCC, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; SCLC, small cell lung cancer; RCC, renal cell carcinoma; MCC, Merkel cell carcinoma; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; PMBCL, primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma; CC, cervical cancer; GC, gastric cancer; MSI-H, microsatellite instability high; dMMR, mismatch repair-deficient; UC, urothelial carcinoma; cHL, classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma; HNSCC, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer. Information on approvals and supplemental approvals was gathered from Drugs@FDA

- In lung cancer, the 4 primary immune checkpoint inhibitors each have a different assay 
- agreement between these assays ranges from poor to high

companion diagnostic device is required for the therapeutic product’s safe and effective use, a complementary test is performed to provide information that is clinically meaningful and will aid in the decision regarding treatment
