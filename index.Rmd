???
Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalisation was performed to select risk factors, prevent over-fitting, and reduce the dimensions of the prediction model [12]. To determine the penalty factor (λ), tenfold cross validation was performed, to maximise the area under the curve (AUC).

Risk groups: 25%, middle 50%, top 25% of risk
A comparison of the predicted probability versus the observed probability for each risk group is shown in Figure, demonstrating that there is a higher probability observed than predicted in the model validation cohort.

Calibration - T4DM
The Brier score was low at 0.07, the Hosmer–Lemeshow χ^2 statistic was 3.92, (p=0.86), and the p-value for the Osius-Rojek and Stukel tests were 0.71 and 0.04 respectively, indicating good calibration within the model development cohort, other than the Stukel test.

Extend45
The calibration according to the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test was poor (χ^2=106, p<0.001). However the Brier score for assessing prediction accuracy was low at 0.13 and the p-value for the Stukel test was 0.62, indicating a good fit, while the p-value for the Osius-Rojek test was p<0.001.

Given this under-prediction, recalibration in the large was performed and the intercept was estimated as 0.67. Once this was taken into account, the predicted probabilities from the model showed better alignment with the observed probabilities

# Extras:  checks and more checks 

1. check relationships of continuous data and outcome

--

2. Account for missing data by assuming missing outcome is no diabetes

--

3. Check for inclusion of any non-zero covariates :

  - Best addition of age gave AUC .bold[0.830] (minor increase from 0.816)

3. Check for interactions

BINGO: HbA1c and treatment

]
]

???
Given that 469 participants had all risk factors and outcome data available, a sensitivity analysis was performed assuming all patients with missing outcome data were not diabetic at two years. This gave a total of 539 patients available to perform logistic regression with LASSO (extra 70 patients) to identify the optimal λ and therefore the optimum risk factors in the model (step one). The previous model of HbA1c and 2-hour glucose by OGTT was within one standard error of the optimal λ, which is considered the most parsimonious model with the consideration of many risk factors (reference).
